This is an e-commerce platform in C++ where users can browse products, add items to their shopping carts, and place  orders. How would you design classes to represent products, shopping carts, and orders, and implement methods for  managing the shopping experience and processing orders 
ECommercePlatform application exemplifies aspects of the Facade design pattern by providing a simplified and unified interface (main function) that hides the complexities of the underlying subsystems (user management, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing). This design promotes ease of use, separation of concerns, and robust error handling, aligning with the principles of encapsulation and abstraction central to the Facade pattern. Thus, enhancing maintainability and scalability of the application in handling e-commerce operations.
